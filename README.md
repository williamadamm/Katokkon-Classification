# Object Detection

This repository contains the code and dataset for an object detection project.

## Project Overview

- Objective: To detect and classify Chili Qualities in real-time using a webcam (Raspberry Pi & Jetson Nano) and Smartphone
- Methodology: Utilizing a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLOv5, SSD) and fine-tuning it on a custom dataset.
- Technologies: Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV, YOLOv5, YOLOv8.
- Hardware: Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, Android devices.
